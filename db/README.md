# Database

First open PgAdmin and enter master password if necessary.
On the lefthand side, click open Servers -> PostgreSQL -> Databases
Right click on Databases, choose Create -> Database...
Database: football
Owner: postgres
click save. (You can choose to close PgAdmin now)

If you wish to change your postgres password to be the same as the one included in version control:
Hit ALT+SHIFT+Q 
This should open your query tool in pgAdmin.
Enter the following query:
ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD '12345';
Hit execute
Your new password is now: 12345
Note: this is also the master password you need to enter when you start up pgAdmin from now on.

Now start up DBeaver.
Create a new connection.
Choose PostgreSQL.
Database name: football.
Click finish. It will run on port 5432
Open the new football database -> Databases -> football -> Schemas -> public.
Right click on public -> SQL editor -> new SQL script.
Paste and run the following:

CREATE TABLE public.teams (
	id serial4 NOT NULL,
	club_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	established_in int4 NOT NULL,
	is_international bool NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT teams_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE public.players (
	id serial4 NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	year_of_birth int4 NOT NULL,
	team_id int4 NULL,
	CONSTRAINT players_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
	CONSTRAINT players_team_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES public.teams(id) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE SET NULL
);

You now created the player and the teams table.
For some dummy data; open new SQL script (same as previous and paste and run the following:

INSERT INTO teams (club_name, established_in, is_international)
VALUES
  ('Manchester United', 1878, false),
  ('Real Madrid', 1902, false),
  ('FC Barcelona', 1899, false),
  ('Paris Saint-Germain', 1970, false),
  ('Brazil', 1914, true),
  ('Germany', 1900, true),
  ('Argentina', 1893, true);

INSERT INTO players (name, year_of_birth, team_id)
VALUES
  ('Cristiano Ronaldo', 1985, 2),
  ('Lionel Messi', 1987, 3),
  ('Neymar', 1992, 4),
  ('Kylian Mbapp√©', 1998, 4),
  ('David Beckham', 1975, 1),
  ('Zinedine Zidane', 1972, 2),
  ('Pele', 1940, 5),
  ('Diego Maradona', 1960, 7);
  
  When you have verified that everything works, you can add automated sequence generation for both tables by running the following queries:
  
  CREATE SEQUENCE team_id_seq START 1;
  CREATE SEQUENCE player_id_seq START 1;
  
  (Don't forget to delete the dummy data, otherwise you will get an error saying that the id the sequencer tries to generate already exists)
